    <h3>Just call me Nichole (❁´◡`❁)</h3>
    <p>HI THERE! I'm Ma. Nichole Abrio. Everyone calls me Nichole.I'm from the Philippines but!
        I live with my family in Dubai.</p>
    
    <p>I'm on the Applied Technology track! I like watching anime and
        reading manga (but I don't have much time these days for those ಥ_ಥ).
        I'm looking for a job while doing online classes so I can help my family
        out. And BYU-Idaho helps out a lot because I can be more flexible with my 
        time through online classes.
    </p>
    <p>Nice to meet you all!</p>
